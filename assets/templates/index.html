            To whoever's reading this: hi! My name is Jerry Li. I'm a first-year student at the University of Virginia
            majoring in Computer Science BA. I've got a long history with computers, to be honest.

            When I was 5, my dad brought home his computer from work - a Lenovo that's so thick it's the thickness of
            three MacBook Airs stacked up. But by the standard at that time it was portable. I was in awe as I watched
            my dad show me around the Windows XP operating system. The buttons, the blue bars in the taskbar and menus,
            and the toggles and sliders all looked so peculiar and intriguing. Recalling those elementary school years,
            there were definitely classes I spent drawing windows and designing what I later learned was called the
            "user interface."
        </p>
        <p id="text-n">
            I learned C in 6th grade, which is a weird place to start with programming languages. By all standards C was
            rudimentary but to this day it remains the cornerstone of the progression of programming.
        </p>
        <p id="text-n">
            Then there was a long hiatus as I was occupied with schoolwork and started to shift my focus to graphic
            design.
